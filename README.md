All of Panopset is completely open source, you could quickly start your
own open source software company, by branching this repository and rebranding it.

If you wish to branch it, and make your branch proprietary, please email
karl@panopset.com with instructions on how to collect shares worth 1%
of your company, or one million dollars, whichever is less.

If a multi-billion dollar company is ever caught with an obvious 
non open source branch by one of their developers, I have a good lawyer, 
and would share with the whistleblower half the net judgement(s) of a 
winnable case. Much easier to do the right thing.
