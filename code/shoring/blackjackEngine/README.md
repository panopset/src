# [blackjackEngine](https://panopset.com/maven/blackjackEngine/index.html)

Blackjack engine used for Panopset Blackjack.

* Data driven counting systems and basic strategy charts.
* Automatic deal, to test both counting and betting strategies at tens of thousands of hands per second.
* Fast deal configuration option, to allow users to skip seeing the results of each hand, just whether or not they made a basic strategy mistake.  I only wrote this, because I wanted this feature.

Prominently displayed in the end product description somewhere must a link to 
[Gamblers Anonymous](http://gamblersanonymous.com), 
along with the following disclaimer:

* "The only claim made about this game is that it will only lead you to ruin, whether or not it has any bugs."

I probably won't take the time to sue you, if you don't abide by these provisions.
It will be enough to trust in cosmic justice, should you foolishly decide to ignore them.
