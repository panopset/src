<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
While using the tools available on this site, information that you enter into fields is 100% transmitted
through <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> secured https, and processed in server
memory solely for the purpose of your immediate data processing cycle.  That information is not
stored anywhere.  When using Panopset desktop applications, nothing is transmitted outbound behind the scenes, except
a request for version information, from the server to your application, so that it may flag you if you need an
upgrade.  All other Panopset desktop software processing is done using web traffic and files that you select, and in
local RAM. All of this is <a href="https://github.com/panopset/src">open source</a>, allowing for easy verification.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>See the Panopset <a href="https://github.com/panopset/src">source code</a>,
        for documentation of active Panopset projects.</p>

<h1>Financials</h1>
<p>Panopset is privately held, has never had debt, and operates on a sustainable cost model.</p>
<h2>Expenses</h2>
<ul><li>
 8 dollars a month for a <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> server.
</li><li>
 Less than 50 dollars a year for <a href="https://domains.squarespace.com/">SquareSpace</a> domain registration fees.
</li></ul>
<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>
The plan is simple, give it away for free to drive adoption, then sell out to a FAANG.
If that ever happens, those who actually paid their <a href="./license.html">license</a> fees, will receive a nice email in response.
</p>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>
<img src="/images/smFlag.png" alt="US Flag"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No overseas accounts, nothing under the table, and no creative accounting.
Panopset is proud to always pay our fair share of taxes.
