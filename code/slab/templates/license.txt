<h1>Desktop Application License</h1>
<p>
Panopset desktop software is currently free, for anyone who can't afford it, and <a href="https://github.com/panopset/pan">open source</a>,
under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 <a href="https://github.com/panopset/pan/blob/main/LICENSE">license</a>, 
slightly modified with two provisions related to the Blackjack module.
</p><p>
If you and/or your business is doing fine, it is $25.00 per year.  Proof of <a href="mailto:karldinwiddie@gmail.com">payment</a> is the license.
</p><p>
Limited offer: $100.00 for a lifetime license, per user.
The first 1,000 who pay for a special permanent license, also get a numbered signed certificate
that they'll want to save in case Panopset ever goes public, or is sold.
