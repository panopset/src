I wrote Panopset Blackjack because none of the simulators
I could find had a fast deal feature.  When practicing the
basic strategy, I don't care about the outcome of the hand,
just whether or not I made the correct decision.

It is entirely your responsibility to independently

its accuracy.

The only claim made about this game is that it will only lead you to ruin, whether or not it has any bugs.

That said, a link to 
<a href="http://gamblersanonymous.com">Gamblers Anonymous</a>
should serve to provide a far better disclaimer, than the 
poor words of an old gambler.

Blackjack is incredibly tedious and tough to beat these days, but I still love the game and go play once in a while.
I see people come and go and make incredibly bad decisions, not splitting 8's etc.
Usually I eventually lose my stake, but I tend to last
longer than the average players. I don't understand why someone would ever sit down at a blackjack table without at
least having the basic strategy memorized. This game helps you memorize the basic strategy, and has card counting
simulation scenarios for you to try, but I wrote those a long time ago when you could still find good tables with
reasonable rules. Nowadays, you can't even re-split aces anywhere anymore, so what's the point, right?
