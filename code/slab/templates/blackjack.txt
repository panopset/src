  ${deskBlurb}.

<p>
I wrote Panopset Blackjack because none of the simulators
I could find had a fast deal feature.  When practicing the
basic strategy, I don't care about the outcome of the hand,
just whether or not I made the correct decision.

It is entirely your responsibility to independently 
<a href="https://github.com/panopset/${GN}/tree/main/code/shoring/blackjackEngine">verify</a>
its accuracy.
</p><h2>
The only claim made about this game is that it will only lead you to ruin, whether or not it has any bugs.
</h2><p>
That said, a link to 
<a href="http://gamblersanonymous.com">Gamblers Anonymous</a>
should serve to provide a far better disclaimer, than the 
poor words of an old gambler.
